<p>Growing up, I was always told I'd make a great lawyer. I mean, I'm sure a lot of kids are told that kind of thing by their doting parents - but I really took it to heart. Without the slightest idea of what a lawyer actually did, I started preparing my law school applications right after getting my B.A. Over the course of hundreds of hours of research during this time, I slowly discovered that the reality of being a lawyer wasn't quite what I'd envisioned. Luckily, I came across the world of programming nearly by accident while studying for the LSAT. And here I am!</p>
