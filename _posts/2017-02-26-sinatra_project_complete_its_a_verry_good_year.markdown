Sweet, sweet victory. Learning activerecord, rack and sinatra have, in many ways, felt like climbing a mountain. Armed only with a rusty pickaxe (my ruby/html/css "skills") I was tasked with climbing mount everest - - that is, to create a proper, fully featured, database reliant web application which persists user data and handles browsing requests without a hitch. A mere month ago I was sad because I couldn't properly code a loop to count spots on a tic tac toe board. Now I'm making apps which I could *almost* imagine being put online for a business. 

And really, that's the great success of this curriculum - once you hit Sinatra, the pieces start to fall in place. You aren't just learning Ruby for the sake of designing CLI programs that your average joe wouldn't know how to boot. Instead, every single piece of your knowledge is utilized towards creating a fully featured project. You can't work with application controllers or create models if you don't know ruby. You can't make a functioning database if you don't understand SQL. You can't make your website look pretty if you don't know HTML & CSS. We, as full-stack developers, have to intimately understand every link in the chain in order to work with real applications. Thus - there is *purpose* to every single little project you've made. Every lab you've solved, every tic tac toe turn method you've agonized for hours over. You need to understand it all, and, I promise, it'll start coming together (yes, even those html/css code-alongs).

As for my project, I made a workout tracker. [Here's a video walkthrough of Gains-Tracker!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NUHQjUVIEM&feature=youtu.be)

A workout tracker is a simple enough idea, but a great one to *flex* my knowledge on (sorry, had to go for the pun). Users can log in, save new workouts, edit those workouts, add notes, add exercises, etc. I took a pretty obsessive approach to security, so passwords are encrypted with bcrypt, salted with a session secret, and web page content is hidden for invalid users. Seems excessive for a simple workout journal, sure, but maybe you're *really secretive* about your excessive amount of chest routines.

I've also learned that front-end web design is not my forte. I can do backend coding like routing, database relationships and object templates all day, but having to struggle with HTML/CSS to get some div containers to line up properly is an absolute nightmare. I'm sure it's the kind of thing that'll get better with experience, but for now, *the front-end development process took just as long, maybe more, than the back-end.* Such is life, I guess.
