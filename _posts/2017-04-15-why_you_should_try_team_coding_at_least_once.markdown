Confession time - I've always felt I do my best work on my own. I'm a pretty focused, intense guy - especially when it comes to my professional endeavors. When I was a student, for example, I always cringed when assigned a group project; invariably, I felt that someone wasn't pulling their weight, or that the logistics of scheduling meetups just wasn't worth the payoff. So, when it came to programming, I put off team coding or working alongside a partner as long as I could. 

That is, until I got towards the end of the Rails curriculum track. After a brutal slog through hundreds of labs, I was exhausted - both mentally and physically. So, when an opportunity to team up for a big final project suddenly appeared, I decided to put my "group-work" prejudices aside and give it a shot. After some brief exchanges over slack, my partner (a super bright person named Liah) and I set up a voice chat room and got to work early one morning.

Right off the bat, I was amazed by just how different it feels to code alongside another person. Instead of sitting at my computer hunched over my keyboard and attempting to debug and untangle my code in complete silence, I had another person to bounce my ideas off of. In coding, two heads really are better than one - bugs were sorted out twice as quickly, and we both breezed through assembling complicated models and methods without many hitches at all. I was amazed by how much more efficient everything seemed, compared to my usual work-flow (get frustrated, make coffee, procrastinate).

Not only did we breeze through a major project in under a day, we also got to experience what it's like to have to verbalize your ideas to another person. This is the kind of thing that any professional developer is going to need to be able to do, and it was excellent to have an opportunity to practice. By the end of the project, I felt rejuvenated - a project which may have taken several days otherwise was done in under 5 hours! I also gained a new-found appreciation of the benefits of working with other people. If there are any stubborn workaholics out there, trust me when I say that team/partner coding is absolutely worth the hassle. 

And, Liah, you were awesome!
