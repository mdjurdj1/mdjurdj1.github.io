I remember being a ruby newbie several months ago, working on my tictactoe project, and accidentally forking the javascript version of tictactoe (a project I'd get to about 600 lessons later). My first reaction was confusion; *"What the hell am I reading? What are all these functions and curly brackets?"*... followed shortly by a sinking feeling that I was in way over my head - that I didn't think I'd ever be good enough at programming to understand, much less write, the stuff I was viewing on my screen. 

And indeed - if we're talking about syntax and simplicity, Ruby is beautiful compared to javascript. Methods are predictably named compared to Javascript's obtuse counterparts, `self` is *way* easier to understand than `this`, and Ruby doesn't have brackets/open parenthesis littering the code everywhere. But, after months of dedicated coding (in reality it was mostly watching Avi lectures while playing online card games), learning Javascript was actually a fairly simple process. See, all object orientated programming languages are more or less the same. Javascript objects serve an identical function to Ruby objects. Methods and functions aren't too different from one another. Prototypes and Classes are likewise comparable. After a few weeks writing in JS - I felt (nearly) as comfortable as I do in Ruby. If that isn't a testament to how awesome this curriculum is, and how well it prepares you, I don't know what is. 

Having achieved high confidence in my coding skill, going into Jquery wasn't too big of a jump. Jquery is seriously cool stuff; the modern web is basically built on the back of AJAX magic. Being able to manipulate the DOM dynamically opens up a world of options - you can stuff your views full of easter eggs and intrusive popups if you wanted to! Finally, you can create a page worthy of adblock! I didn't do anything too special for my Jquery project, but it was an excellent learning experience just attaching listeners to links and buttons, as well as figuring out how to manipulate json data sent through my custom API endpoints.

Getting to work adapting my rails project for Jquery was a pretty simple process - the hardest parts were the initial few hours of looking at my elaborate rails partials and controllers and realizing I would have to piece everything apart so that I could use Jquery to render resources instead. After I found my groove, it was another half dozen hours before my index page rendered a collection of Appointments seemlessly on the DOM, and my contacts could show their nested appointments at the click of a mouse.

As I look towards the end of the curriculum, I feel more confident than ever in my skillset and abilities. Here's hoping react and redux treat me as well as Rails and Jquery did!
