### To be perfectly honest, I've never really liked school.

After twenty years of being a student, I can probably count the number of courses I genuinely enjoyed on a single hand. Thus, I've always had serious issues mustering up the motivation to excel in academia. *Why* was I being forced to write essays on asian diaspora poetry for a grade? Why did I need to take this economics class as a graduation requirement? What purpose does an intro to psychology course serve for someone who doesn't want to be a psychologist? Having a holistic, educated opinion on a broad range of topics is fine and dandy, but wasn't college supposed to prepare me for the adult world? Were any of these courses really important enough to my future to warrant months of effort and coursework? What exactly am I going to do after I graduate?

Yeah - okay, I get it; a college degree these days is just about a requirement for most steady, decent jobs. I understood (especially after my first year out of school) that life would be much, much harder without that first degree headlining my resume. So, I had decent enough motivation to continue - I need to graduate in order to not be a cashier for the rest of my life. Fair enough. My issue was that nothing I was learning felt tangible or meaningful to me. I was disconnected from nearly every essay I wrote, every test I studied for, and every assignment I submitted. For those of you who genuinely enjoyed your courses in school & college; I am truly envious of you.

*The joys of waking up at 8am for some sociology class you only took for a graduation requirement.*

The process of learning programming has been the complete opposite of everything I've just described. For the first time in my life, I wake up ecstatic knowing that I'm going to **learn** something new and refine my skillset. One might ask, what's the difference between studying programming and the things you studied in college? The difference is that I'm creating something everytime I sit down to code. It seems so simple, but it's the difference between admiring someone else's painting, and learning how to paint your own masterpiece. I have a *direct connection* to the things I create. I feel a profound sense of accomplishment whenever I complete a project and it works like I expect it to. When I fail, I'm reminded that I have so much to learn. Either way, the process is immensely addicting and feels rewarding on a very personal level.

If you're anything like me, you want to feel passionate about whatever it is you're studying or doing at work. It's difficult to feel passionate about working retail, middle-management, or any of the thousands of types of nameless office jobs that provide a servicable living. Programming is an escape from that, a skill you can learn which will relentlessly challenge your intellect and provide you the freedom of creative expression at the same time. I can tell you (from experience) that it's a difficult skill to pick up, but it's certainly worth it.

I mean, it sure beats writing essays about asian diaspora poetry.
